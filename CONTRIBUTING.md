Let's keep this simple shall we?

* All PR's must have fully passing test cases proving fixed bug or newly added functionality.
* Python code should be PEP8 compliant with the included ``./clean_imports`` shell script used to sort imports.
* Just be smart and follow the conventions already set out within the rest of the codebase really. :)
